# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I am struggling with putting it all together at the moment, honestly.  Somewhere after arrays, I started getting lost

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I am still in the middle of an Unproductive struggle!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to practice arrays again and how to put them together with for statements.  I'll need to adjust my calendar and review in the morrning.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
many questions about array and for statements integration!  I'll have to ask my small group or get into a study hall
